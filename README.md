# Piroshap Theme

This theme is a Hugo port of [Aaron Shapiro's portfolio website](http://aaron.mn/). It is meant to be a very minimalist portfolio theme for showing off case studies.

## Installation

Follow the themes guide on the [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/). Briefly, within your Hugo folder:

```sh
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/xaviablaza/hugo-piroshap-theme.git
```

## Getting started

Copy everything within `exampleSite` into the root of your website folder, and edit it to your hearts content!

If you're lazy, you can do this within the `themes` folder:
```sh
$ cp -r hugo-piroshap-theme/exampleSite/* ../
```

Add `theme = "hugo-piroshap-theme"` to the  `config.toml` in your root folder, or when serving, use `hugo server -t hugo-piroshap-theme`
